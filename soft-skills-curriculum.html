                              LEAP (Learn Experience Act Perform) is designed by the School of Leadership for IT
                              graduates. Through experiential learning, participants realize their potential and develop
                              their competence to take on professional responsibilities. The program aims to enhance
                              their employability to contribute productively toward their organizations.
                              <br /><br />
                              The soft skills module will consist of seven components;
                         </p>
                         <h2 class="event_heading_curriculum">Personal Leadership (10 Hours)</h2>
                         <p class="event_text">
                              The objective of this component is to enable trainees discover their potential and
                              resourcefulness and apply it for their growth and benefit to others. Participants go
                              through various reflective experiences to realize their potential and strengths as the
                              source of their confidence. They learn to set goals based on a larger purpose, identify
                              their values and set standards to continuously aspire for. Through simulations,
                              participants experience paradigm shifts enabling them to apply their IQ (Intelligence
                              Quotient) and EQ (Emotional Quotient) to be accountable for their actions.
                         </p>

                         <h2 class="event_heading_curriculum">Emotional Intelligence (12 Hours)</h2>
                         <p class="event_text">
                              Assists trainees to understand themselves and others; develop compassion and create safe
                              spaces for all to perform at their best. Participants understand people are different and
                              have their own set of experiences and conditioning that drives them towards a particular
                              behaviour. They learn principles to form and manage relationships (personal and
                              professional) and develop a personal toolkit to build strong networks.
                         </p>
                         <h2 class="event_heading_curriculum">Communication (26 Hours)</h2>
                         <p class="event_text">
                              Trainees learn principles of effective communication to ensure greater result achievement
                              and more meaningful and productive interpersonal relationships. Besides verbal and
                              non-verbal communication, included are business communication; grooming and mannerism;
                              meeting etiquettes and customer relationship management.
                              <br /><br />
                              Listening is a key trait emphasized during this module, which then goes on to practice
                              story telling and presentations. Communicating clearly and effectively, while being open
                              to feedback, listening and understanding the “other” point of view are skills that are
                              practiced repeatedly to build both confidence and skills to communicate well.
                         </p>
                         <h2 class="event_heading_curriculum">Teamwork (18 Hours)</h2>
                         <p class="event_text">
                              Trainees learn to work together collaboratively toward a common vision. This allows each
                              team member to play their part more effectively to ensure organizational goals of cultural
                              harmony and business growth are achieved. Participants understand how teams operate in
                              sync and how trust is developed to generate win/win results. Focusing on diversity and
                              adversity, trainees learn how opposites complement each other. A puzzle is not complete
                              unless the different pieces are placed together to form the design. In the final section,
                              participants learn to initiate change; identify resistance and manage it positively to
                              enable teams, departments and organizations to boldly lead into the future.
                         </p>
                         <h2 class="event_heading_curriculum">Creativity and Innovation (18 Hours)</h2>
                         <p class="event_text">
                              Interconnected and complex processes are better understood if broken into smaller chunks.
                              Critical and analytical thinking enables us to find solutions in a myriad of complexities.
                              Root-cause analysis enables us to find solutions to problems but Lateral Thinking fosters
                              creativity. In anticipation of stakeholder’s need for variety, uncertainty and perpetual
                              change, Design Thinking allows us to manage and deliver on demands. Participants
                              understand how decisions impact outcomes; types of decision making processes; risks
                              involved in making decisions and how to be prepared to mitigate them. Negotiation skills
                              are part of this component as it brings to the table creative solutions for win/win
                              outcomes.
                         </p>

                         <p class="event_text">
                              Being a professional requires having a management skillset. This requires the ability to
                              plan, organize, lead, control and achieve. Since the customer is at the core of any
                              business, trainees learn about ‘customer service to the third-degree’. This implies
                              facilitating an environment of partnership to enable the customer to learn, grow and
                              contribute to their customer. This component includes facets of Operational Excellence and
                              Process Understanding. Also integrated are basic principles of project management and how
                              to initiate, plan and effectively deliver projects.

                              To standout, certain skills are required for job market entrants. Topics included are
                              leadership basics, work ethics and ‘Shine in the industry’ to allow trainees to develop
                              high standards of professionalism while being connected to higher ideals of contribution.
                              Steering through this path is challenging, yet fulfilling.<br /><br /><br />

                         <p class="event_text">No matter where you are or what you do, time and stress management skills

                              of life. A person’s credibility stems first and foremost from their sense of time, which
                              in our century, is truly global. Working with multi-cultural clientele requires that the
                              person serving them has the etiquettes and mannerism acceptable to most. How to sit,
                              stand, walk, eat, conduct meetings, hold conversations – these make an all-rounder
                              professional.<br /><br />

                              Shape Up is the closing segment of the entire soft skills training program that gives
                              immediate vision and a long-term formula for self-belief and future development.
